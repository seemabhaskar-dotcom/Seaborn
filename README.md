Seaborn is used for exploratory and explanatory data analysis in Python-based data science projects. It allows analysts and developers to:

Visualize relationships between variables (e.g., scatter plots, regression plots)

Analyze distributions (e.g., histograms, KDE plots, box plots)

Compare categories and groups (e.g., bar plots, violin plots)

Create correlation heatmaps for feature analysis

Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn offers improved aesthetics, sensible defaults, and built-in statistical aggregation, making it especially useful for rapid insight generation and presentation-quality visualizations.
